# Stellar_Classification_Using_ML
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the Stellar Classification dataset by applying ML models and to present my insights.
Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging,Boosting ,KNN,SVM.
Compared the results to recommend the best ML model.
